# Zombie Fortress Plus+
This is a source port (kind of) of the original Zombie Fortress Plus+ mod for King Arthur's Gold by [Transhuman Design](https://github.com/transhumandesign/kag-modded-server-mods).
It should work with recent versions of KAG.

Warning: this mod is still being tested and some things MAY not work.

# Installation
1. Make a folder under `Mods/` directory (for example, `ZombieFP1.7`).
2. Download the mod source and put it in the created folder. Now your folder should contain folders named Entities, GUI, Maps, etc.
3. Add the folder name you've put the mod into to the `mods.cfg` located at the game folder.
4. Edit autoconfig.cfg and set `sv_gamemode` to the mod folder you've created.
5. Done! Run the dedicated server or test in a localhost mode.
